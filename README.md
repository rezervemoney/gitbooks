# Welcome to Rezerve

Welcome to the Rezerve Money docs. Here you’ll find everything you need to know about RZR, a decentralized community-driven reserve currency that redestributes all of it's revenue back to stakers.&#x20;

Rezerve was 100% fair launched with no VCs, no insiders and 100% community owned.

By integrating continuous self-assessment and taxation mechanisms, RZR ensures that assets are held by those who value them most, promoting active participation and reducing speculative hoarding.

If at any time the terminologies used in the documentation aren't clear or confusing, feel free to head over to the [Glossary section](other/glossary.md) for term definitions or join our [Discord](http://discord.rzr.finance/) for more information.

## Key Features

* **Continuous Price Discovery**: Every asset on RZR is always for sale at its self-assessed price, ensuring trading opportunities whenever valuation shifts.
* **Harberger Tax Revenue:** A predictable, ongoing tax on declared asset values that builds protocol-controlled value without selling tokens.
* **Seamless Compounding Bonds:** Our RZR bond integrates vesting and auto-restaking over three 4-day cycles, capturing every epoch’s yield without manual steps.
* **Flexible Governance:** Proposals cover tax rates, bond discounts, surplus thresholds and emergency pause controls, all enacted via on-chain votes.
* **Robust Safeguards:** A multi-tier defense ladder—from reward throttling to inverse bonds, surplus-buffer draws, stake slashing and insurance auctions—keeps the protocol solvent under stress.
