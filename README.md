# Welcome to Rezerve

Rezerve is a fair-launched reserve currency that captures every cent of protocol revenue and sends it straight back to the people who stake it—no VCs, no insiders, no backstage market-makers. With every epoch the protocol buys up floor assets, so the price you can fall to keeps rising, giving you a steadier store of value than Bitcoin’s boom-and-bust cycle

Here you’ll find everything you need to know about RZR, a decentralized community-driven reserve currency that redestributes all of it's revenue back to stakers.&#x20;

If at any time the terminologies used in the documentation aren't clear or confusing, feel free to head over to the [Glossary section](other/glossary.md) for term definitions or join our [Discord](http://discord.rzr.finance/) for more information.

## Key Features

* **Continuous Price Discovery**: Every asset on RZR is always for sale at its self-assessed price, ensuring trading opportunities whenever valuation shifts.
* **Harberger Tax Revenue:** A predictable, ongoing tax on declared asset values that builds protocol-controlled value without selling tokens.
* **Seamless Compounding Bonds:** Our RZR bond integrates vesting and auto-restaking over three 4-day cycles, capturing every epoch’s yield without manual steps.
* **Flexible Governance:** Proposals cover tax rates, bond discounts, surplus thresholds and emergency pause controls, all enacted via on-chain votes.
* **Robust Safeguards:** A multi-tier defense ladder—from reward throttling to inverse bonds, surplus-buffer draws, stake slashing and insurance auctions—keeps the protocol solvent under stress.
