# Welcome to Rezerve

Rezerve Money (RZR) is a decentralized treasury accumulation protocol with one mission: **accumulate 1 million ETH**—powered entirely by community and DeFi. Rezerve does this through collateralized lending, bond sales, and rebase yield.&#x20;

Rezerve takes heavy inspiration from MicroStrategy, OlympusDAO & DeFi stablecoins to achieve this goal and was 100% fair-launched with—no pre-sales, no funding, no VCs, no insiders and no backstage market-makers staying as close to the Ethereum ethos as possible.

Here you’ll find everything you need to know about RZR and it's mechanics.

If at any time the terminologies used in the documentation aren't clear or confusing, feel free to head over to the [Glossary section](other/glossary.md) for term definitions or join our [Discord](http://discord.rezerve.money/) for more information.

## Key Features

* **Aggressive ETH Accumulation:** With access to capital from bond sales and lending markets, Rezerve aggressively borrows/raises debt to acquire more ETH. Acquired ETH is either kept in the treasury or deployed as liquidity to the RZR/ETH token pair.&#x20;
* **Staking**: RZR token holders can additionally stake their tokens to earn rebase rewards.
* **DeFi Integrations:** Besides having an exposure to ETH, RZR also further integrates with DeFi protocols like DEXes and Lending markets, allowing RZR holders to either speculate or capture more yield.
* **Decentralized Governance:** Right from day 0, RZR is decentralized with an on-chain governance that allows token holders to make changes to the protocol.
* **Transparent & Decentralized:** No single entity can take down the protocol and all asset holdings are publicly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.
