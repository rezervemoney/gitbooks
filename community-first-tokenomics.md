# Community First Tokenomics

We launched Rezerve as a pure fair-mint because every shortcut that typical projects take—seed-round vesting, bonus founder allocations, headline-grabbing airdrops, stealth snipes—creates structural sell pressure that strangles long-term upside.&#x20;

Rezerve’s launch mechanics embody the original crypto ethos of open, permissionless ownership—and that credibility is exactly what gives it room to grow into something genuinely big.

In this document we detail all the design decisions we took when trying to launch Rezerve.

| Common Pitfall        | Consequence for Holders         | Rezerve’s Mitigation                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ICO & Vesting         | VC unlock waves → sell pressure | No ICO, no vesting; fully circulating supply |
| Founder/VC Allocation | Mis-aligned incentives          | Founders buy at market price; zero bonus     |
| Airdrop Hype          | Free coins dumped on market     | No airdrops; demand must be real             |
| Insider Snipes        | Concentrated supply, rug risk   | Fair-launch; no pre-mint, no sniping         |

With the summary above, we go into detail about each of the decisions we took when trying to build Rezerve.

## No ICO, No Vesting Schedules

Most launches allocate huge chunks of supply to private-round investors or team wallets, locked behind cliff/linear vesting. When those cliffs expire, the fresh coins slam into the order book:

* [CryptoRank’s “Dump-Pressure”](https://cryptorank.io/token-unlock/pressure?utm_source=chatgpt.com) dashboard grades many upcoming unlocks High → Very High because VC wallets control double-digit percentages of supply.&#x20;
* [A 2024 Keyrock study of 237](https://crypto.news/token-unlocks-almost-always-negative-for-price-keyrocks-study-reveals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) unlock events found that _“token unlocks are almost always negative for price,”_ with team/VC cliffs triggering the steepest drops.&#x20;
* [BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/vcs-may-dump-these-altcoins/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) showed VCs up 1,100 % on several altcoins and preparing to exit into retail liquidity.&#x20;

**Rezerve’s stance:** there was no private / public sale and therefore no vesting cliff waiting to detonate. Every circulating token was minted with real capital under the exact same rules for founders and community.

## Bootstrapped & Founder-Fair

Audit fees, infrastructure and initial liquidity were paid out-of-pocket by the founders. They received zero bonus tokens and had to mint/buy on-chain like everyone else. The usual “founder allocation” overhang simply doesn’t exist.

## No Airdrops — Real Demand Only

Free-token giveaways create short-lived buzz but long-lived sell pressure:

* [AirdropAlert’s volatility review: ](https://airdropalert.com/blogs/how-airdrops-influence-token-price-volatility)airdrops lead to “immediate sell pressure and price declines.”&#x20;
* [CryptoNews analysed 534 airdrops](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/70-of-airdropped-tokens-fail-to-deliver-profits-heres-why) and found 70 % failed to deliver profits once the free coins hit exchanges.&#x20;

**Rezerve’s stance:** no airdrops. Growth is organic, fuelled by genuine demand rather than a one-off marketing splash.

## No Insider or Sniper Advantage

On-chain forensics show many meme launches are cornered from block zero:

* [Cointelegraph details](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/front-runs-sniper-bots-and-self-buys) how sniper bots front-run liquidity adds, letting a handful of wallets capture outsized positions.&#x20;
* [BDC Consulting counted](https://bdc.consulting/insights/MarketResearch/memecoins) 14 000 sniper-bot buys across just 28 open-source scripts in 2024.&#x20;
* [The “HAWK” influencer coin](https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/business/hawk-tuah-girl-haliey-welch-launches-cryptocurrency-which-crashes-shortly-after-launch) crashed -91 % in three hours; blockchain data showed “a few wallets controlled most of the supply.”&#x20;

**Rezerve’s stance:** The unique launch mechanics of Rezerve prevented pre-mints and snipes; there is no team wallet and no insider whitelist, so every participant faced the same open-market conditions.

## Conclusion

By eliminating hidden unlocks, freebie dumps and insider allocations, Rezerve is intentionally _boring_ — in the best possible sense. Every token in circulation required real skin-in-the-game capital, aligning founders and community from day one.
