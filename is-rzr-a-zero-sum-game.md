# Is RZR a Zero-Sum Game?

In crypto, it’s often said that everything is a zero-sum game: for every winner, there must be a loser. Value doesn’t appear from thin air it shifts from one side of the system to another.&#x20;

Rezerve acknowledges this reality but reframes it in a way that benefits those aligned with the protocol.

## The Nature of Zero-Sum Games in Crypto

Crypto has always been a battlefield of zero-sum games. For every trader who wins big, another walks away with a loss. It’s pure PVP (player vs. player) especially in the world of memecoins, where speculation runs wild and gains often come at someone else’s expense.

The money doesn’t magically appear; rather it shifts from one pocket to another. That’s the essence of a zero-sum system. Someone wins, someone loses, and the cycle repeats.

## How is Rezerve Different?

In the Rezerve system, instead of users fighting each other for scraps, the protocol and its community fight together and the losing side isn’t other users/trades, but it's rather the entire US dollar itself.

### The Winners - RZR Stakers and Holders

Through Rezerve’s core mechanics of [raising debt](mechanics-rzr/raising-debt-and-acquiring-eth/), executing [protocol-driven buybacks](mechanics-rzr/protocol-driven-buybacks-pds/), and [redistributing value to stakers](mechanics-rzr/staking-rzr-srzr/); the system continually channels gains toward RZR stakers and long-term holders.&#x20;

Every cycle strengthens protocol-owned supply and liquidity, which increases control and resilience. Those who believe in the mission and commit capital are directly rewarded as the protocol captures more ETH and grows stronger.

### The Losers - Fiat & External Systems

On the other side, the “losing” party isn’t individual users, but rather the US dollar and the system behind it.

When users stake stablecoins into Rezerve, those dollars are effectively converted into ETH exposure and absorbed into the protocol. Over time, this reduces reliance on fiat, shifting value from the traditional financial system into a decentralized, community-owned reserve.

## To Summarize

RZR isn’t just another zero-sum game. It’s a reallocation engine moving value away from fiat and into a trustless, decentralized reserve owned by its community.

It's a massive trade against the US dollar and inflation. For Rezerve and it's holders to win, the US dollar and it's system should fail in the long run. This is in essense a zero-sum-game at a Macro scale.
