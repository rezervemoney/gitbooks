# How To Capture 1 Million ETH?

In traditional finance, MicroStrategy has demonstrated how a single entity can build a massive position on a scarce asset—in their case, Bitcoin—by using excess cash and low-cost debt to relentlessly acquire and hold it as a primary reserve asset.

As Bitcoin’s value increases, the company’s debt becomes cheaper to repay, and bondholders gain the option to take yield or convert bonds into MicroStrategy stock for potentially greater upside.

MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy has transformed the company into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle. As Bitcoin rallied, the firm’s market capitalization surged, and MSTR’s share price climbed over 2,700% from its 2020 lows, vastly outperforming Bitcoin itself.&#x20;

This leveraged approach created a feedback loop: higher BTC prices boosted market perception, which in turn increased MicroStrategy’s access to cheap capital for further accumulation.

To understand more about how MicroStrategy works see [The MicroStrategy Method](the-microstrategy-approach.md).

## The Rezerve Approach

Rezerve applies a similar strategy—but with Ethereum, and without central gatekeepers.&#x20;

When capital is inexpensive, Rezerve utilizes on-chain bond sales and decentralized lending markets to expand its ETH treasury. Unlike a corporation or billionaire-led strategy, Rezerve’s accumulation engine is fully community-driven. Participation is open to all, and benefits are distributed among all contributors.

Because Rezerve is entirely on-chain and decentralized, its holdings are transparent and publicly verifiable at all times. There is no single point of failure—no entity, person, or government can seize control. The treasury belongs to the people.

## The Risk—and the Reward

MicroStrategy’s method delivered extraordinary results—but carried significant risks. The company took on debt, tied its fate to Bitcoin’s price, and accepted share dilution. When Bitcoin rallied, the outcome was striking: MSTR’s share price rose over 2,700% from its 2020 lows, far exceeding Bitcoin’s own gains. This aggressive accumulation transformed the company into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin, and the market rewarded its conviction.

Rezerve’s model follows a comparable high-risk, high-reward path. RZR’s performance depends on community trust, robust smart contract security, and Ethereum market cycles. As a token representing a claim on Rezerve’s growing ETH treasury—and one that can be staked, deployed in DeFi, or used in governance—RZR’s price movements could be amplified in the same way MSTR’s stock was.

When Ethereum’s value rises and the treasury continues to grow, RZR could outperform simply holding ETH, delivering gains through asset appreciation, staking yield, liquidity rewards, and network effects.
