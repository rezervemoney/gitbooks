  Rezerve ecosystem

# Overview

USD69 is a decentralized stablecoin system designed to support a predictable and sustainable borrowing strategy for ETH.&#x20;

It combines a collateralized stablecoin treasury with tokenized bond vaults, allowing the protocol to steadily accumulate ETH while rewarding users who participate.

The main components are:

1. **USD69 Treasury:** lets you mint and redeem USD69 stablecoins using supported assets like USDC or WETH.
2. **USD69 Bonds:** An ERC4626 tokenized vaults where you can stake USD69 for fixed periods to earn rewards, similar to traditional government bonds.

### Why Does This Matter? Borrowing ETH Predictably

The ultimate design of the system is to allow the Treasury to borrow ETH in a controlled and predictable way. Here’s how it works:

1. **Users Mint USD69:**  Treasury accumulates stable collateral (USDC, WETH, etc.).
2. **Users Stake in Bonds:** Locked USD69 provides the protocol with stable, time-bound capital.
3. **Treasury Borrows Against USD69:** Using the locked liquidity, the protocol can borrow USDC from lending markets.
4. **Treasury Buys ETH:** Borrowed USDC is converted into ETH, growing reserves in a predictable manner.
5. **ETH Exposure Drives Rewards:** Over time, ETH appreciation and DeFi yield strategies generate returns, which flow back to bondholders as rewards.

This loop ensures that every user action minting stablecoins or staking them in bonds contributes directly to the protocol’s ability to borrow ETH in a sustainable, non-speculative way.
