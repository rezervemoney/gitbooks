# Roadmap: Path to 1 Billion FDV

We are excited to share with you the roadmap for Rezerve and how we aim to make it become one of the most influential currencies within the crypto-sphere. We document our roadmap in 5 unique phases.

Each phase deliberately widens the circle of influence: first we perfect the mechanics at home on Sonic, then we prove dominance there, replicate the playbook across other major chains, open the doors to everyday retail users through mainstream apps and top-tier exchanges, and finally court national funds and pension schemes once the currency’s hard-asset treasury and on-chain cash-flows speak for themselves.

Think of it as a self-financing expansion loop where every success funds the next frontier—always anchored to the same ethos of community ownership, Bitcoin-backed security, and meme-powered culture.

Are you ready? Let's dive in.

## Phase 0 — Genesis on Sonic

Rezerve’s story begins where block-space is fastest and fees are negligible: Sonic. A fully audited, on-chain fair-launch distributes every RZR at the same public price while founders seed the first liquidity pools and pay the gas themselves.&#x20;

Governance, staking and bonding all go live on day one, so the community is writing and ratifying policy from the very first blocks. Early culture is purposefully playful—weekly meme contests, live AMAs and referral quests—because shared jokes forge the social glue a currency needs before charts and metrics can take over.

The earliest “listings” are intentionally local: Sonic’s flagship DEXs, where fast block-times and near-zero fees let the community experiment without friction.

Rezerve completed this phase with it's launch on June 12th 2025 and it's acquisition of over $1mn in TVL in less than 2 weeks.

## Phase 1 — Sonic Domination

Once the base is secure, we press every strategic angle Sonic offers. RZR becomes accepted collateral in the leading money-markets; treasury yield starts buying Bitcoin and liquid-staking Sonic & ETH, pushing hard-asset backing visibly higher each epoch; and new RZR-denominated stable-pairs ensure swap fees loop straight back to stakers.&#x20;

By the end of the phase our aim is for a majority of Sonic’s total value locked to touch RZR in some form, proving the currency is not just resident on Sonic but structurally woven into the chain’s economics and daily user flow.

The first Tier-2 centralised exchanges list RZR during this phase, giving mobile-first users an on-ramp that doesn’t require bridge know-how.

Rezerve is currently in this phase right now and will complete this phase once it becomes the top 5 revenue generating protocol on Sonic and has 10mn in TVL

## Phase 2 — Cross-Chain Bridgeheads

With Sonic conquered, Rezerve starts branching outward. By using LayerZero's OFT standard, we can securely bridge RZR to Ethereum L2s, Solana and BNB, accompanied by outpost treasuries that seed the first liquidity on each frontier.&#x20;

We start to hit EVM and non-EVM chains together, massively outreaching various communities that go beyond the Sonic ecosystem. Chain-specific “Ambassador DAOs” localise campaigns so that a Solana trader hears a different pitch than an Arbitrum yield-farmer, yet both plug into the same global treasury and vote.

In this phase we will also start to actively push RZR across T1 exchanges and aim to get more users involved in the trading and speculation of Rezerve.

At the same time, the protocol starts it goal of acquiring BTC and auto-converts a portion of it's treasury into BTC until a 5000-coin target is reached, vaulting Rezerve into the ranks of the world’s largest Bitcoin treasuries while giving every holder exposure to crypto’s hardest asset.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the most exciting phase and will conclude once Rezerve hits 100mn+ in TVL and has become a top protocol in at least three chains (Ethereum, Solana and any other promising chain). This phase has not yet begun.
{% endhint %}

## Phase 3 — Multi-Chain Dominance

RZR contracts deploy natively on the top five smart-contract ecosystems, all governed by a single cross-chain voting layer that prevents fractured liquidity or fork risk. A universal staking portal lets users delegate in one click, regardless of which chain their tokens live on, and routing logic automatically chases the best yield.&#x20;

The meme engine scales too: cross-chain tournaments crown seasonal “Meme Lords,” limited NFT drops commemorate inside jokes, and collaborations with flagship memecoins amplify reach.&#x20;

Exchange reach leapfrogs too: regional Tier-1 CEXs add RZR spot and perp markets, bringing real-time price discovery to millions who have never used a Web3 wallet. By year-end, Rezerve aims to rank among the world’s ten largest corporate or DAO Bitcoin treasuries—a hard-asset signal that backs the meme with metal.

By the close of the year, Rezerve’s treasury aspires to sit among the top-ten global corporate or DAO Bitcoin holders, while its cultural footprint spans every major crypto timeline.

## Phase 4 — Retail & Mass Adoption

Having secured on-chain mind-share, the final sprint is to leap off-chain. A mobile super-app offers one-tap RZR savings with fiat on-ramps via Apple Pay and Google Pay; debit cards let people spend their staking yield at coffee shops, not just inside wallets.

Regulated exchange-traded notes list in key jurisdictions so traditional investors can buy RZR from their brokerage accounts without touching Web3. Sponsorships in esports arenas, music festivals and viral meme campaigns push the brand where future holders already gather.&#x20;

The success metric here is simple and audacious: tens of millions of everyday users treating Rezerve as naturally as they do dollars, while the protocol’s Bitcoin chest and meme culture keep the narrative exciting for the next wave.

## Phase 5 — National-Scale & Institutional Adoption

The final horizon is to anchor RZR inside the balance sheets of nations and pension funds. With a decade of transparent on-chain cash-flow and a Bitcoin-backed treasury that rivals mid-cap central banks, Rezerve positions itself as a programmable, yield-bearing reserve asset.&#x20;

Sovereign wealth funds and public pensions begin allocating small but growing slices—initially through the regulated ETN wrappers, then directly on-chain as custody norms mature. Major accounting bodies publish guidance for DAO-treasury assets, removing the last compliance barriers.&#x20;

At this stage, RZR obtains listings on national stock exchanges via fully collateralised ETPs, and its yield curve becomes a reference rate for DeFi and TradFi alike.&#x20;

The meme that started on Sonic now underwrites city bonds, powers pension payouts and sits beside gold in central-bank dashboards—proof that a community-forged currency can scale from block zero to national reserve without ever surrendering its ethos.

## Enduring It All

Across every phase, four principles remain non-negotiable: community-first governance, relentless BTC accumulation, a perpetual meme flywheel that keeps things fun, and a monetary throttle that never prints more RZR than its cash flow can justify.&#x20;

Together those guardrails let Rezerve dominate its birthplace, replicate the model across chains, and ultimately step into the mainstream without ever diluting the ethos that started on Sonic.
