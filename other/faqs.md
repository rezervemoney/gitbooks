# FAQs

## Will there ever be a governance token?

No. RZR is the sole and only token in the Rezerv ecosystem. There is no separate governance token now or in the future. Upgrades and treasury management are handled by a timelocked multisig, not a voting cartel. This keeps the design lean, minimizes governance attack vectors, and prioritizes protocol solvency over politics.

## Can I lose money?

Yes. RZR can still be volatile, especially in early phases. While the floor price cannot fall, market price above the floor can fluctuate. Risk comes from overpaying far above floor, bonding at peak premiums, or aggressive leverage. Always do your own research

## How is the RZR token backed?

Each RZR token is backed by real assets in the treasuryâ€”USDC, ETH, LP tokens, and yield-bearing instruments. The protocol maintains a publicly verifiable floor price that reflects the value of assets per token. This price only ratchets up when the treasury earns revenue.

## What happens if RZR trades below the floor?

If RZR ever trades below 97% of its floor price, the protocol uses treasury funds to buy back and burn tokens until the price recovers. This gives RZR holders a tangible, on-chain redemption path and reinforces the integrity of the floor.
