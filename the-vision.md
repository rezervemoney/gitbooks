# The Vision

When designing Rezerve, we took a lot of points into consideration. We looked at stablecoins that have succeeded and failed, free floating currencies, Bitcoin and other scarce assets, and the entirety of the DeFi landscape.

With this in mind, we kept the following principles for Rezerve.

## 1. 100% Community Driven

Rezerve is engineered from the ground up as a community-driven reserve currency: every token in circulation was minted through an open, fair-launch process, so there are no venture allocations or insider discounts lurking in the background. Governance isn’t outsourced to a corporate board—it lives directly in the wallets of stakers, who propose and ratify every policy change on-chain.&#x20;

All protocol revenue—from trading fees to yield on reserve assets—flows 100 % back to those same stakers, creating a transparent dividend loop that rewards active participation instead of passive rent seeking. By fusing fair distribution with real cash-flow and on-chain voting, Rezerve turns its holders into the true stewards of monetary policy, proving that sustainable value can—and should—be built and owned by the many, not the few.

## 2. Fair Launched - No VCs & Insiders

Rezerve began life as a true fair-launch: no seed rounds, no venture carve-outs, no insider allocations, and no shadow market-making deals behind closed doors. Every single token in circulation was minted transparently on-chain at go-time, available to anyone—whales and first-time wallet holders alike—on exactly the same terms.

That radical neutrality means there are zero unlock cliffs or discounted bags waiting to dump, so price discovery is driven by genuine market demand, not insider liquidity events. It also ensures governance power can only be earned in public—through staking, bonding, and active participation—rather than bought in a private round.&#x20;

By removing privileged entry points and letting supply start at block zero in the open, Rezerve aligns incentives from day one and proves that a reserve currency can be built for the many, not the few.

## 3. Bear & Bull market aligned

Rezerve is architected to breathe with the market instead of fighting it.&#x20;

In bull phases, a positive flywheel captures elevated swap fees and bond spreads, routing 100% of that revenue to stakers while an expansion throttle mints new RZR only up to the cash-flow it just earned—so growth never outruns backing.

When sentiment flips, the protocol auto-shifts into Shield Mode: bonding pauses, treasury yield is diverted to on-market buy-backs, and the rising floor of tokenized T-bills, LSD yield, and other hard collateral tightens the draw-down ceiling block by block.&#x20;

Combined with a rising floor price that continously increases as revenue gets generated, this allows Rezerve to be both bear and bull market aligned.
