# RZR vs OHM

The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape has witnessed innovative models aiming to optimize asset allocation and value accrual. Two notable protocols in this domain are the Rezerve Money and OlympusDAO. While both seek to enhance economic efficiency within DeFi, they employ distinct mechanisms to achieve their objectives.

| Feature               | Rezerve Money                                | OlympusDAO                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Value Mechanism       | Harberger Tax (self-assessed value taxation) | Rebasing (supply adjustments)          |
| Asset Transferability | Always for sale at declared price            | Requires active trading or unstaking   |
| Governance Token      | DrDre                                        | OHM                                    |
| Economic Incentive    | Active participation via taxation            | Passive income through staking rewards |
| Price Stability       | Market-driven through self-assessment        | Protocol-driven via supply adjustments |

## Conclusion

While both Rezerve Money and OlympusDAO aim to optimize value within the DeFi ecosystem, their methodologies differ significantly. RZR Protocol’s Harberger Tax model fosters continuous market-driven price discovery and efficient asset allocation.

In contrast, OlympusDAO’s rebasing mechanism focuses on supply adjustments to stabilize token value. The choice between the two depends on the specific goals and preferences of participants within the DeFi space.
