# Protocol Driven Buybacks (PDS)

Protocol Driven Buybacks (PDBs) are a mechanism within the RZR protocol that use the protocolâ€™s ETH reserves to repurchase RZR tokens from the market.&#x20;

Unlike discretionary buybacks, PDBs are governed by transparent rules tied to protocol-level metrics such as [protocol-controlled supply (PCS),](protocol-owned-supply.md) ETH reserves, and liquidity depth.

The primary goals are to:

1. Accumulate ETH in the protocol treasury.
2. Increase PCS (target: >90%).
3. Reinforce RZR scarcity and stability through controlled supply management.

## Why buybacks vs diluting existing holders?

When the protocol acquires ETH from the open market using debt, it has three options to persue.&#x20;

1. Introduce the new ETH

PDBs balance short-term reflexivity (Ponzi-like growth dynamics) with a long-term ETH-backed foundation. In early phases, buybacks create scarcity and rapid PCS growth. In maturity, the protocol transitions into a sustainable reserve system with deep ETH liquidity and high PCS, positioning RZR as a robust reserve asset.
