# Protocol Owned Liquidity

In the Rezerve Money, PoL represents the on-chain assets the protocol itself owns and controls—distinct from user-supplied liquidity. PoL underwrites every RZR token, provides perpetually available liquidity, and funds yield-generating deployments.

By sourcing PoL from both bond proceeds and Harberger-tax inflows, RZR ensures that staking rewards (rebases) and strategic treasury actions are always backed by real capital. Robust governance over PoL allocation and risk management safeguards RZR’s peg and amplifies long-term protocol health.

## What Is PoL in RZR?

Protocol Owned LIquidity in RZR is the sum of all stablecoins, LP tokens, and Harberger-tax receipts held in RZR’s treasury smart contracts. Unlike Total Value Locked (TVL), which includes assets users can withdraw, PoL is reserved exclusively for protocol objectives—backing RZR at a minimum $1-per-token ratio and seeding permanent liquidity on decentralized exchanges (POL).

In RZR’s dual-token design, PoL fuels both:

* Rebase rewards paid to sRZR stakers, converting incoming capital into yield.
* Surplus buy-backs of RZR, creating a deflationary sink when reserves exceed target buffers.

## How PoL Accumulates in RZR

1. **Bond Sales -** Users purchase RZR at a discount by depositing assets (e.g., USDC, DAI, LP tokens). These assets flow directly into PoL, strengthening the protocol’s collateral backing. (Read [PCV by Sherpies](https://medium.com/sherpa-library/in-pcv-we-trust-e07ed4c5051))
2. **Harberger-Tax Inflows -** Every sRZR holder self-assesses their position’s value and pays a continuous tax (e.g., 5% APR) on that valuation. These recurring payments accrue in PoL as a stable revenue stream, even when bond demand wanes.
3. **Yield Deployments -** PoL assets may be strategically deployed—such as providing liquidity to new pools or farming yield—then harvested and returned to PoL, compounding the treasury over time
